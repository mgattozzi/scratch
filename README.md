Scratch is a command line tool to jot down ideas as they come up in the terminal rapidly.
It allows for easy access and editing of ideas using the CLI.

Scratch is written in Haskell.

You can do whatever you want with the code but no contributer will be held liable for any
damage if used in another project or through usage as it is written.
